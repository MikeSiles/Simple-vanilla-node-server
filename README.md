# The Simplest Node Server You'll Ever See
This is a node server that delivers one page.
That's it.
It does not use express, it does not use some cool new library.
It delivers one thing using one short js file.
It doesn't even do error checking. The filepath is hardcoded.
Have fun with it. Tweak it out. Build something new and different from the ground up.
